The Smart Lighting App uses the times of sunrise and sunset to control lighting in the home.
The level of natural light that in a room will vary all year round as the sun is rising and setting at different times each day.
As a result, the period each day for when artificial light is required will vary.
The Smart Lighting App calculates the sunrise and sunset times based on the location and uses these times to control the lighting.

Tools, Technologies and Equipment:

- Raspberry Pi 3 Model B+
- LED (simulates the light)
- Sunwait
- Python
